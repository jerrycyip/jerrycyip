- 👋  Hi, I’m @jerrycyip
- 👀  I’m interested in web development opportunities, especially with MERN/SERN stack (MongoDB/SQL DB, Express, React + Redux, Node), JS (ES6+), HTML, CSS.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning the finer nuances of advanced MERN and SERN fullstack web development plus GraphQL/Apollo.  In the past, I also worked a lot with SQL and Python, particularly for Machine Learning and Data Science applications (e.g. Numpy, Pandas, SK-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyTorch).
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on new projects that can leverage my software development skills and passion for building products that empower people to do more.
